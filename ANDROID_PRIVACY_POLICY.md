## Msg2Mars: Privacy policy

Welcome to Msg2Mars, available now on Android!

This is an open source Android app. The source code is available on GitHub.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect and store any personally identifiable information.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please open an issue.
